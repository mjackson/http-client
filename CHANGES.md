## [v5.0.0]
> TBD

- Change default 'as' for the parse middleware to prevent returning `Response#body` (a `ReadableStream` without a 
`body` property) as the response

## [v4.3.0]
> Sep 30, 2016

- Rename `onResponse` to `recv` and `enhanceFetch` to `enableRecv`. This makes the association more clear.
- Deprecated redundant top-level `fetch` export. Use the global `fetch` function directly instead.
- Added `debug` middleware, deprecated `requestInfo`.

[v4.3.0]: https://github.com/mjackson/http-client/compare/v4.2.0...v4.3.0

## [v4.2.0]
> Sep 29, 2016

- Add `parse(parser)` middleware that puts the result of the parse in `response.body`
- Deprecated `parseJSON`, use `parse('json')` instead

- Build everything into the package root

[4.0.0]: https://github.com/mjackson/http-client/compare/v4.0.0-0...v4.0.0

## [v4.0.0-0]
> Apr 27, 2016

- `handleResponse` runs response handlers top to bottom, just like Express
- Added `options.responseHandlers` array to specify an array of transforms to
  run on the response after it is received
- Added `enhanceFetch` to top-level exports for adding `options.responseHandlers`
  support to an arbitrary `fetch` function
- Added `options.fetch` to fetch functions created using `createFetch` so users
  can swap out usage of the "global" fetch function, which makes testing easier
- Removed callback API to preserve `fetch` method signature
